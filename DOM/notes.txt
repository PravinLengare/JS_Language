DOM -> DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL 
    - The DOM (Document Object Model) is the bridge between your HTML code and JavaScript.

* HTML is only text and static
* dom is dynamic and live 

NOTE : When a browser (like Chrome) loads your page, it takes your HTML and converts it into a giant Tree of Objects called the DOM.
       JavaScript cannot modify the text file (HTML), but it can modify this Tree.

The Tree Structure --> 
The DOM organizes everything in a hierarchical tree.

    Root: The document object.

    Branches: The tags (Elements) like <body>, <div>, <ul>.

    Leaves: The content (Text nodes) like "Hello World".


Why is it called an "Object Model"?
   - Because every single part of your HTML is turned into a JavaScript Object

   const h1 = {
    tagName: "H1",
    id: "title",
    innerText: "Hello",
    style: { color: "black", fontSize: "2em" },
    // ... hundreds of other properties

    }
    Because it is an object, JavaScript can easily say h1.style.color = "red".

The DOM is an API -->
    The DOM is technically an API (Application Programming Interface).
    It provides a set of methods (like .getElementById, .querySelector,
    .appendChild) that allows scripts to update the content, 
    structure, and style of a document while it is currently being viewed.
