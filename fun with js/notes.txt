Lexical Scope and Closure 

Summary :- 
What is it? A function bundled with its lexical environment.

Key Feature: It remembers variables from its parent scope even after the parent has returned.

Why use it? For data privacy (encapsulation) and functional programming patterns like currying.


1. Lexical Scope is the Rule: 
    "The child function is allowed to see the parent's variables."

2. Closure is the Mechanism: 
    "The child function remembers those variables even if the parent function dies."
